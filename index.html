      <p>
        Welcome to my <strong>First Webpage</strong>! However you managed to end up here, i'm glad your here! And if you care to read, here's a little info about me.
        I was born on a small caribbean island. I have a deep love for my family, music, art and recently coding!! So as you can see adding in sleep and commuting and basically eating, I don't really have time for much more. But if your interest align with any of those, please don't hesitate to reach out!
