        Hello, my name is Abdel. Im a Brooklyn Native. Arabic and English native speaker. I started my programming journey freshmen year of high school, when I joined the robotics class. We programmed little robots we built. Then I moved onto drag and drop coding on snap! By Berkeley and on scratch. After that I learned my first real language, python until the end of high school. Got into college and studies electrical engineering and little bit of code, mainly C++. Alongside that joined pursuit and learned full-stack development. Javascript, css, html, and react.
