        Hello, my name is Abdel. Im a Brooklyn Native. Arabic and English native speaker. I started my programming journey freshmen year of high school, when I joined the robotics class. We programmed little robots we built. Then I moved onto drag and drop coding on snap! By Berkeley and on scratch. After that I learned my first real language, python until the end of high school. Got into college and studies electrical engineering and little bit of code, mainly C++. Alongside that joined pursuit and learned full-stack development. Javascript, css, html, and react.

      <p class="hardest-bug__description">
        The hardest bug I encounter was a little funny. I was working on a research project on the fibonacci sequence. Part of the project was for me to create code that creates the sequence to a certian length. Problem is, when one lining the code, you can only start the sequence with 1, 1. but when you use a regular loop, you can start with 0, 1.
        
        I went online to see what I can do so the one-liner can start with 0,1. Turns out, everyone on the internet has a different opinion on it. Some people you have to start with 0, 1 and others say it starts with 1, 1. So istead of fixing the bug, I presented both solutions and got away with it because not even the interent agreed on the solution.
